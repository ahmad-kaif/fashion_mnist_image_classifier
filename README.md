# Building an Image Classifier Using the Sequential API


### Fashion MNIST
Fashion MNIST is a drop-in replacement for MNIST. It has the same format as MNIST (70,000 grayscale images of 28 Ã— 28 pixels each, with 10 classes), but the images represent fashion items rather than handwritten digits. Each class is more diverse, making the problem significantly more challenging than MNIST. For example, a simple linear model reaches about 92% accuracy on MNIST, but only about 83% on Fashion MNIST.
